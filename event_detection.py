    Args:
        location (dict): Dictionary describing the location in parameter space.
        targets (list): List of target names associated with the time series data.
        batch (numpy array): Time series data for a batch of trajectories. `batch`
            has three dimensions representing which trajectory in the batch, which
            target in a trajectory, and which time step in a target's trajectory.

    Keyword Args:
        transient (float): Fraction of time series data to ignore to ensure
            only measurements at steady state are returned.
        min_x_dt (int): Resolution limit in time index space for event detection.
        z (float): Fraction of the determined effective maximum count which will
            be the midpoint between the low and high transition thresholds.
        w (float): Fraction of the determined effective maximum count which will
            be the distance from the midpoint between the low and high transition
            thresholds to those thresholds.

        dict: Dictionary with two entries. Event detection returns the batch of
        trajectories for plotting under the `batch` key. Measurements of the
        events averaged over the batch will be under the "results" key. This

def segment_events(x, y, high, low, min_dt):
    """Determine the event transitions in a time series trajectory (x, y).
    An event identifies a "high count state" entry/exit for a species.
    When `y` passes from below `th` to above `th`, a low to high transition may occur.
    when `y` passes from above `tl` to below `tl`, a high to low transition may occur.
    An event is always defined as a pair of transitions (low to high and high to low).
    Events are filtered to meet the following standards:

        - At least one point is above th (i.e. sufficiently tall).
        - The end points are below tl (i.e. system is low before/after event).
        - The event contains at least `min_dt` points
          (i.e. sufficiently long compared to resolution).
        - There are at least `min_dt` points between any two events
          (i.e. system stabilizes between events).
        - Before and after any event there are at least `min_dt` points
          whose maximum value is below `th` (i.e. pre/post low state is stable).

    The word "stable" means no transition happened for `min_dt` consecutive points.

    Args:
        x (numpy array): The time axis of the trajectory.
        y (numpy array): The count axis of the trajectory.
        high (float): The low to high transition threshold.
        low (float): The high to low transition threshold.
        min_dt (int): A resolution limit for how events are defined.
